    # List recurring and one-time invoices billed for this Scrub IP service Returns the recurring and one-time invoices generated for the Scrub IP service so the caller can verify billing status, present a payment history, or initiate payment on an unpaid invoice. Use after placeScrubOrder (to find the new invoice id) or before cancelScrubIp (to surface outstanding balance). Path param: &#x60;id&#x60; (integer, required) — service ID from getScrubIpsList. No body/query parameters. Returns ChargeInvoiceRows (array of invoice objects with id, amount, status, due dates). Errors: 401 unauthenticated; empty result if id is not owned by the session account. Caveat: paid invoices remain in history; filter on status client-side. Siblings: getScrubIpDetails, placeScrubOrder, cancelScrubIp.
